# About

[DECADES](https://decades.cs.princeton.edu/) is a $5.8-million project being led by PIs from Princeton and Columbia. The project is part of an effort to create hardware and software that can be reconfigured on the fly to accelerate important applications. This project aims to keep electronics going after Moore’s Law is a thing of the past.

# Our Contribution

* Collaborated with Princeton, Columbia, and **UCSC** on a heterogeneous many-core system, contributing compiler and runtime support for efficient CPU-FPGA/GPU execution.
* Designed a novel heterogeneous decoupling method, achieving a `2x` speedup on Barnes-Hut; results were used in `Phase 2` of DARPA SDH program and contributed to selection for `Phase 3`.
