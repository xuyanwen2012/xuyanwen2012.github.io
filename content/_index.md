# 👋 Hi

I am a final-year **Ph.D. candidate** in the Department of *Computer Science & Engineering* at the University of California, Santa Cruz ([**UCSC**](https://www.ucsc.edu/)), supervised by Professor [**Tyler Sorensen**](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/).

**My research interests** include:
* `heterogeneous computing`
* `programming languages`
* `compilers`
  
I am particularly interested in accelerating workloads on tightly coupled CPU-accelerator (e.g., GPU/FPGA) systems, with the aim of realizing the full potential of these architectures. I also believe that programmers deserve better tools for developing heterogeneous applications; this fuels my exploration of novel compiler techniques and programming language features. You can find more details in my [research projects](projects) and [publications](publications).

```c++
struct Research {
    // Tightly-coupled CPU + {GPU, FPGA, TPU}
    using Architecture = Heterogeneous<UnifiedMemory>;

    void optimize() {
        Compiler::bridge(HighLevelPL, PeakPerformance);
    }

    bool goal = "Unleash full hardware potential";
};
```

<!-- Before starting my Ph.D., I was an `indie game developer`, and many of the game projects are shown in my [portfolio](games). Aside from academics, I am a competitive `fencing` (🤺) athlete and a certified fencing `coach` by *U.S. Institutions of Higher Education*. I earned my diploma of *Instructor at Arms in Foil* in the year 2022, and *Provost at Arms* in year 2025. -->
