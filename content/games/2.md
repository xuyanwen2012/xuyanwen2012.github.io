This project is an ambitious technical overhaul of the RPG Maker XP engine, designed to facilitate massive medieval battles. It features a dual-layered gameplay loop: a high-level Tactical Map (SRPG) for army movements and a "Custom Battle" mode (ARPG) where the player leads hundreds of troops in real-time.

Key technical achievements include:

- **Custom AI & Unit Logic:** Units operate under a commander system where they follow complex behaviors like charging, retreating based on morale, and protecting fragile archer lines.
- **Physics & Realism:** Implemented projectile motion for missiles and a realistic damage system that accounts for individual armor and shield values.
- **Original Assets:** Most of the code was written from scratch, and I personally drew the character sprites and designed their animations to fit the scale of the battles.
