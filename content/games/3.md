This project served as an early technical proof-of-concept for breaking the standard RPG Maker XP grid constraints. It features a custom-coded real-time fighting system that shifts the perspective from top-down to a side-scrolling beat 'em up style.

The engine focuses on:

- **Real-Time Collision Detection:** Moving away from turn-based logic to handle fluid character movement and hitbox detection.
- **Scripted Animation Sequences:** Utilizing custom RGSS scripts to manage complex attack animations and player-input responsiveness.
- **UI Customization:** A redesigned interface to support the real-time nature of the combat, departing from the engine's native menu-driven systems.
